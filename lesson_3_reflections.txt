local?

  	When I want to share my work with other people easily.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
